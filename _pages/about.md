Hello! I am a junior student currently pursuing Bachelor of Business Administration with a Minor in AI Convergence at Yonsei University in Seoul, South Korea. Staying in Korea and exposing to varied PaaS & SaaS business models, I like learning about how they offer differentiated products/services integrated with AI and other sustainability trends. 


Academic Background
======
I maintain a GPA of 3.96/4.3 and have completed coursework in AI, Deep Learning, Data Science, and Management Science. My education equips me with a solid foundation in both business and technology, helping me to leverage data and analytics in making informed decisions. I look forward to studying more about data analytics, business analytics, digital marketing, and data-driven decision-making. I am deeply interested in how these fields intersect with ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) initiatives and green product offerings.


Professional Experience
======
I have had the opportunity to work with several forward-thinking companies and projects that align with my interests:

Wah & Hua Pte Ltd (Singapore): As a Market & CSR Research Intern, I focused on identifying market gaps and developing strategies to help the company enter the Vietnamese market with sustainability in mind.
Eventus (South Korea): As a Market Research Intern, I worked on improving customer experience and helped develop strategies for international expansion.
Wicked Lover (South Korea): As an ESG Strategy Student Consultant, I created marketing strategies for upcycled products and helped improve sales through data-driven, ESG-focused campaigns.



Projects & Initiatives
======
Beyond internships, I’ve co-founded multiple organizations and led initiatives that reflect my entrepreneurial spirit:

International Business Initiation: I helped establish a network of potential business partners and secured funding for this project, aimed at fostering global business connections.
HCMC Project Community: As co-founder, I spearheaded partnerships with over 30 student-run organizations, reaching more than 10,000 students.

Honors & Scholarships
------
I am honored to have received several scholarships, including the 2024 GKS Global Scholarship and the Kim Dong Jun Scholarship. I’ve also participated in fully-funded programs such as the Global Entrepreneurship Summer School in Shanghai and the Aspire Leader Program associated with Harvard University.



Skills
------
I’m fluent in Vietnamese, English (IELTS 8.0), Korean (TOPIK 5), and have an elementary proficiency in Chinese. My technical skills include Python, R, Microsoft Excel, SPSS, and SQL.
